- Autoregression (AR) The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components.
- Moving Average (MA) The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components.
- Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components.
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and without seasonal components.
- Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA) The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and/or seasonal components.
- Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and/or seasonal components and exogenous variables.
- Vector Autoregression (VAR) The method is suitable for multivariate time series without trend and seasonal components.
- Vector Autoregression Moving-Average (VARMA) The method is suitable for multivariate time series without trend and seasonal components.
- Vector Autoregression Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors (VARMAX) The method is suitable for multivariate time series without trend and seasonal components with exogenous variables.
- Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) The method is suitable for univariate time series without trend and seasonal components.
- Holt Winter’s Exponential Smoothing (HWES) The method is suitable for univariate time series with trend and/or seasonal components.
